Connect N
Connect N is a GUI game I made using the Java Swing API. It functions similarly to Connect 4, but with variable board sizes, and was comprehensively planned using UML diagrams before starting. During development, I followed the Model-View-Controller artitecture in order to build a complete, functional, and bug-free desktop app with a leaderboard, settings, info screen and other features. This project demonstrated the complexity of even a simple desktop app, and the organizaitonal skills necessary to execute it.

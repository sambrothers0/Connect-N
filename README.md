This repository contains all the necessary code for a GUI-based Connect-N game in Java. 
This project was created using the Java Swing API and uses an MVC architecture.
It includes a leaderboard feature which stores the previous best score and updates whenever a new best score is acheived. 
The game has 3 different modes: small, medium, and large, which require different amounts of connected pieces to win.
The game has a turn counter, buttons to place pieces, and a computer algorithm which the player plays against.

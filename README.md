## Connect N

This repository contains all the necessary code for a GUI-based **Connect-N** game in Java.

This project was created using the **Java Swing API** and follows an **MVC architecture**.

Features include:
- A **leaderboard** that stores the previous best score and updates whenever a new best score is achieved.
- **Three game modes**: small, medium, and large — each requiring a different number of connected pieces to win.
- A **turn counter**, interactive **buttons** to place pieces, and a **computer algorithm** that the player competes against.
